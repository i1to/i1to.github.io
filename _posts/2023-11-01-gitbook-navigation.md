As network engineers and developers, a deep understanding of network protocol specifications is crucial. I've compiled a series of RFC documents on network protocols such as NETCONF and YANG, and made them available on GitBook for better reading and learning. This article provides a navigation guide to these documents.

## What is GitBook?

GitBook is a modern documentation platform that allows teams to create, publish, and share knowledge. It offers a simple yet elegant way to organize and present technical documentation, making complex content easier to understand and navigate.

I use GitBook to organize and publish RFC documents related to network protocols. These documents have been carefully translated and annotated, making the originally abstruse RFC specifications much more accessible.

## Network Protocol Documentation Navigation

### NETCONF Configuration Protocol (RFC 4741/RFC 6241)

NETCONF provides a mechanism through which network device configurations can be installed, manipulated, and deleted. It uses XML-based data encoding for configuration data and protocol messages.

### YANG Data Modeling Language (RFC 6020)

YANG is a language for modeling network configuration and state data. It's designed to create conceptual models of configuration and state data that are implemented by network management protocols like NETCONF.

### NETCONF Event Notifications (RFC 5277)

This RFC defines the event notification mechanism for the NETCONF protocol, allowing network devices to send asynchronous messages to subscribed clients, notifying them of changes in device status.

### NETCONF over SSH (RFC 4742)

This document describes how to use Secure Shell (SSH) as the transport layer for NETCONF messages, ensuring the security of network configuration operations.

[View Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/gitbook/rfc-4742/){:target="_blank"}

### YANG 1.1 Data Modeling Language (RFC 7950)

YANG 1.1 is an updated version of the YANG language, adding new features and improvements that make data models more flexible and powerful.

[View Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/gitbook/rfc-7950/){:target="_blank"}

### YANG Interface Types Definition (RFC 7223)

This RFC defines a set of YANG modules for modeling configuration and state data for network interfaces, providing standardized data models for network device interfaces.

## YumaPro Related Documentation

YumaPro is a suite of tools for developing and deploying network management solutions based on NETCONF and YANG. Here are links to related documentation:

## How to Use These Documents

These documents have been compiled during my learning and work process, and primarily include:

- English-to-Chinese translations of original RFC texts
- Explanations and annotations of key concepts
- Practical application examples and best practices
- Common issues and solutions

You can access the documents directly on this website by clicking the links above. You can also browse all documents from the [GitBook index page]({{ site.baseurl }}/gitbook/). If you prefer to view the documents locally, you can clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/i1to/gitbooks.git
cd gitbooks
# Install GitBook CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g gitbook-cli
# Start GitBook server
gitbook serve
```

## Conclusion

Network protocols are the core of modern network infrastructure, and a deep understanding of these protocols is essential for network engineers and developers. I hope these compiled documents will help you better learn and apply these protocols.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to submit an issue or pull request on GitHub, or leave a comment below this blog post.

## Future Updates

I plan to continue expanding this collection with more protocol documentation and practical examples. Some upcoming additions include:

- RESTCONF Protocol (RFC 8040)
- YANG Library (RFC 7895)
- NETCONF Call Home (RFC 8071)
- Implementation guides and tutorials

Stay tuned for these updates, and don't hesitate to suggest topics you'd like to see covered.
