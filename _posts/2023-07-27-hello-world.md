## Why I Started This Blog

I've decided to start a blog. I've been considering writing one for a long time, but I never knew what to write about.

I often felt that every technical problem had already been thoroughly explained on someone else's blog, and probably better than I could do it. However, that's not always the case. Many times, I've had to perform multiple Google searches to identify the issue. Sometimes, after spending hours searching the internet, I've pieced together a solution to a problem that wasn't actually described on anyone's blog.

I realized that these solutions are exactly what I could write about. Of course, anyone with a good mind can solve problems themselves, but through blogging, I might save future searchers some time. I've also found that writing helps me keep track of problems I've solved and helps others better understand what I spend my time doing.

I always struggle with interview questions like "Tell me about some challenges you faced in this project" or "What's the most difficult bug you've dealt with?" Unfortunately, I tend to forget what I've done once I move on to the next thing. Yes! This blog can serve as a record of some of the things I've done, and I just need to read what I've written to refresh my ideas.

Perhaps my biggest objection to blogging is that I feel I don't have enough time to write. As it happens, this is still an objection. I plan to write whenever I get the chance, but this blog, like anything else, is an experiment. I'm trying out Jekyll, although I might try other platforms later. To get started, I'm sticking with a simple theme (to the horror of perfectionists), but it's actually not bad at all.

So, now I have a blog!

## Moving Forward

This blog will focus on:

1. **Technical solutions** to problems I encounter
2. **Learning notes** from my studies and research
3. **Project documentation** to track my work
4. **Thoughts and reflections** on technology and development

I hope that by sharing my experiences, I can contribute to the community and create a valuable resource for others facing similar challenges.
